# The brain

I started learning/educating myself in the matter of [BCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainâ€“computer_interface) and I started researching more into the human brain and it's structure, and when I found out how much energy it uses, I thought, what can [20 watts](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2816633/) even get you in real life. Let's say you're using a lower end laptop, that just by itself is 30 watts AT LEAST, 30 watts for 8 hours and then it's done, you need to go back to your charging station. Okay, you might say the laptop is quite powerful too, but then again, my laptop goes for 50 watts and goes to 100 degrees once it has to discern where a basketball is in a video. So, one point for humans.

Where does this lead us? We got this really efficient and powerful box in our heads, but what can we do with it to make it better? That's the new accelerationist mentality, when you got something good, try to make it better. Chasing excellence is the next step in human evolution. Learning how to integrate nature with technology will bring us ever closer to touching God. Singularity awaits.
