# Hello World

This is the first post, marking the start of something that may be regarded as a blog for some, and a diary to others. I'd like it to one day grow to a place where people can get to learn and experience a bit more than everyday life. A place where people can see and read something they usually don't. 

I've always loved to create and share knowledge people would find useful in some practice, and in the future period I want to focus on a couple of things that interest me, which are:
- low level computing
- digital design
- mathematics

These are a couple of areas I want to explore in the coming months/years and I wanted to kind of share my journey.

But until then, I'll leave you all with
{% highlight c %}
void HelloWorld(){
  printf("Hello World! \n");
}
{% endhighlight %}


Goodbye.
