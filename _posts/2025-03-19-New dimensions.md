# Dimensions

There actually were levels to it. I did not think I could do it. But you know just when you think you can't that's when you figure out who you are, when the ending is unknown and the distance is unknown, that's when you face the kid in the mirror, how long can you keep on going with no incentive? With no motive?

I don't know. I just went. And I kept on going and I kept on going and going and the crowd went wild. The feeling was there. [This video made me think of something](https://youtu.be/9dQR4pjPRAE?si=JF9HskUxIWe5E5pH&t=894), "All of a sudden I start to minimize everything, I start to find solutions that aren't of achievement but second best, I'm doing this all in my head, calculating while running, and then I start to think about the dreams, waking up in the middle of the night with the dream of failure". But that doesn't hit. This hits. "I have all that, all the times I talked about it, thought about it, studied it, put the numbers down, trained it, retrained, MONTHS AND MONTHS AND MONTHS, I'M TIRED OF IT, I'm tired of it. Tired of wanting it. So fuck you legs. I want to put it to rest. ". That hits. That's what dimensions are. Nobody can see it. But the old me is dead and buried. Dead and buried. He's gone in the previous dimension, and this one is gonna raise it to new levels.

What now? What has actually happened? To get to here we must understand the will, the community behind the madman. The madman would be nowhere without the community. All the friends all the professors. Putting down the stones for me to just be able to EXPLODE into a new state of matter. It's never just one man. But there is only one man every day.

All the role models man... Greg Plitt, Geohot, Terry. I love those guys man. I love so many people so much I want to cry. Life has been kind. I think I am becoming ready to accept victory. The universe has decided to give it to me and I think I have become mature enough to accept it with gratitude.
