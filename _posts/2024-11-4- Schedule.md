# Schedule

I've always loved to think about how much time there isn't and how fascinating it is when things are actually fast. With that in mind I was thinking about my schedule, the idea was to spend about 3-4 hours every day to study, and I just wanted to do a small write up to see how much is that really possible. This is a personal goal of mine which I intend to achieve in order to manifest my other ambitions such as publishing a scientific work before the end of my bachelor studies.

## Sleep

Sleep is quite important, all the recovery is done while sleeping and resting, and similar can be said about studying, you actually do learn and understand concept while reading unlike when working out. But something a bit more interesting happens when you rest/sleep after studying, the question always comes down to, is it better to knock down a few more pages or just hit the bed? This [study](https://sci-hub.se/https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01834.x) provides us with the answer. Always better to guarantee those 8 hours. So, when we got that out of the way, we lose 8 hours of the day.

## University

Now that we have 16 hours left over, let's allocate that during the day while we are awake. Let's say an average day at uni will cost us about 4-5 hours, it would be okay but there is another issue. We have to get there. That's another 2 hours on the way to the uni and back. So now we are at 6-7 hours and with that we now have a total of 9-10 hours to work with. 

## Life

Life always come's up with a way to screw us when we least expect it, so we need to keep some time in the buffer for it just in case. Let's say a road gets closed down, or you meet a friend. How much time will that take? Let's put in an hour or two in the reserve.

## Training

It is obvious that just studying is not a sustainable model long term, the body and the brain are connected more through physiology that one may think, that was the original inspiration before this blog by the way. So, for one to be able to grow and learn simultaneously, one must devise a clever solution to 2 problems, ensure enough physical activity for the body to release [BDNF](https://sci-hub.se/https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2018-0192), that will be different for everyone, but for this part, we must set aside at least 2-3 hours per day to ensure our physical well-being. 

## Summary

In total, we have the following:

- 8 hours sleeping
- 6-7 hours at the uni
- 2 hours just in case.
- 2-3 hours for our body
- 2 hours for food (necessity)

This leaves us with 20-22 hours of our day filled up as it is. How doable are 3-4 hours now? Well. That remains for me to find out. I love exploring the concept of time and will delve into optimizing this schedule even further, I believe there are a lot of corners to cut and I will explore possibilities.

But I will try and maintain this goal as a kind of experiment. I would love to see where 3-4 hours get me in life.
