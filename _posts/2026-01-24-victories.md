# Patterns

One time I wrote, "I mostly write when I am sad", yet this time, due to the overwhelming will within myself to say "this too will pass" I have neglected to write. Even though my brain had the best intention, it didn't pass. Some may say the pain within me has gotten worse, over the past couple of years I cannot recall anything but being happy. I could explain why even. Happy. All of the time. While yes, I do acknowledge that there were some bad moments here and there. Ask me now, I cannot recall when those happened.

Why give this lengthy introduction???

Everything non-ideal in real life must have its lifespan. Whether its hours, days, weeks, months, years. Everything ceases at one point. So does my happy period. But why? Why must victory defeat us every time? This is the question I cannot fathom to answer. It is so difficult to understand. But no more. This is the lifestyle I'm gonna have to reject, too long have I had too much of everything, it is time for me to reject my hedonistic nature and reach into asceticism.
