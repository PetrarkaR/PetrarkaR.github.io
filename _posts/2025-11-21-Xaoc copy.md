# 12 hours left

Been sitting here for the past few hours just thinking. Most people have resolutions by now... but whats there to resolute? There isn't anything I want now that I didn't want in the year 2025. There isn't much to say now. Nothing really changes. There is no need to overblow it, just keep doing what you do. Never stop being you and never lose your smile.

```python
year=2024
print(f"Happy new year ^_^{year+1}")
```
