# Often overlap

Man. Have things taken a turn. One moment goes by and boom. It's the 24th, around midnight as I write this, and I still cannot believe some of the things that have happened.  It seems life doesn't care if it even takes me out of the loop. But why? What happened?

I'll tell you what. Just a sec. We gotta take a moment to reflect upon all the bad that has come to us in this year and how we were able to refrain from indulging into it too much and were just able to live with the flow of life, uninterrupted by all the harm. That's what's special about this journey. We are moving at the speed of life.

Currently it's 02:14, I sit at my table 12 hours after I just had the opportunity to get a job doing what I love for a small company that will probably be a great starting point in my career. I love just getting down and dirty with all the math and the digital logic and everything. But maybe I'll write to you guys about that later in life.

It's been about 3 days since I passed one of my greatest fears at the uni. Physics exam. It's not that it's hard, I just don't like it, I think its stupid and intolerable. That (along many other things) is just my opinion though! After that I do not think anything else can stop me in my wake. 

But the thing that warms my heart the most is that maybe we will get a company off the ground and into running mode near the end of this year. Maybe it's all going to compile into something great. And I'm happy I've been given the opportunity to be a part of that. That's something special. Imma tell you guys all about it tho. Don't worry.
