# Goals
I don't believe in new year resolutions in the sense that you can't magically come up to me one evening and tell me what you want, don't believe that's happening ever, if that happens you are lying to me. That's a lie. You tell me you came up with your wishes that evening and that is what you want to do this year? Crazy. 

I hold a belief that goals are an accumulation of life's experiences and one's natural inclinations. Nothing more, an individual often has a hard time forcefully changing their sails in one direction in order to achieve something larger than themselves. That is why with writing this I wanted to think about a few things I want to accomplish this year, yes, I am fully aware it is april.

Let's do one definite goal, like something that is quantifiable, start a company. What kind of company? Not really sure yet, all I know is that I want us to solve a problem. Not really sure what problem either. I work for a start-up, unsure exactly how it even still exists or why, but I wanted to reflect a bit on my experience there, people usually say that your first "work" experience you will be clueless and not have an idea what's happening. Somehow I am the only person here that understands a thing or two, that scares me. How are you gonna tell me that I, as someone who has never worked has to explain to someone else what is happening in the system, wild.

The thing with being so young is you can still experiment and play, it gets a bit scary when the window closes. I still have time to play.

We'll solve a problem, I promise.

But let's go back for a second. What do I want to do this year? I wanna hammer in the basics, I know I said this is the year for exploding and going forward, but I think you can explode and hammer in what you know already. Let's go.


{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#pragma vector aligned
#include <immintrin.h>

void main(){
    printf("how do you multiply a matrix?");
}
{% endhighlight %}
