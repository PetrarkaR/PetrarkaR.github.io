# New year

With the coming of the new year and the current university blockades I was thinking to pick up more responsibilities in my personal life. That is easy to say, I think it's even easier to pick up duties, but to actually adhere to them and to not lose yourself in them is the hard part... I feel that is something that has happened to me in the recent time.

I feel that as if the biggest predictor of your success in something is how heavy it is on your heart, if you constantly obsess over it you are bound to be good at it, or at least okay... you can never fail at a thing that means that much to you. 

## Actual responsibilities

The actual responsibilities that I have taken upon myself are to lead a team of 12 people to re-do 2 websites, one is a simple static website which can be done in WP and the other website is a whole web-app with a database. Now, I think the reader can understand where the difficulty lies, I have to organize, lead and coordinate 12 people between 2 projects and make them actually learn and write code. It never seemed like an easy task. 

Along with that I am now an administrator of a student organisation with 50+ members. You tell me how easy that sounds.

Regardless, I still believe in myself to do it, over the years I have managed to accumulate enough people and technical skills to be able to lead a team to 2nd place at a competition. Administration is not so tough as you just press buttons like a bot.

I forgot I have a job. And exam pre-requisites. Oh. Not so fun now is it.

I need to make python tooling to increase my efficiency cause with this efficacy I think I'll end up crashing down and burning the whole ship with me. This was supposed to be my break out year, not my break down year.
