# Solving problems

I've wanted to do a sort of a challenge for a while now, challenge myself in a way, try to perform something every day for a while, now with the self-imposed 3-4 hours per day of studying, I have something concrete to put in there, as "studying" is a bit too abstract, you can categorize anything as studying nowadays. Whether reading a book, or a blogpost on something you like, it is all learning. 

But I wanted to do something that is a bit more technical in it's nature so I turned to 2 sites that provide a good platform for challenges;

## Leetcode

`LeetCode LLC, doing business as LeetCode, is an online platform for coding interview preparation. The platform provides coding and algorithmic problems intended for users to practice coding. LeetCode has gained popularity among job seekers in the software industry and coding enthusiasts as a resource for technical interviews and coding competitions`
- from the wikipedia, I've chosen this cause thinking more algorithmically can help in any field, and coding every day is useful in the field I want to put myself in. You can use anything, which is also a plus, I appreciate that, I'm gonna try to learn languages as I go but I think I will stick with python for now.

## Project Euler

`Project Euler (named after Leonhard Euler) is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs. The project attracts graduates and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes 911 problems as of October 9 2024, with a new one added approximately every week. Problems are of varying difficulty, but each is solvable in less than a minute of CPU time using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer.`
- from the wikipedia, this was chosen again because it can use programming, but I think some problems are solvable purely by math, so I think that will be nice addition to the challenges, see what can be solved purely by using math and which require a bit of computing power. 

## Conclusion

Solving problems is fun, sometimes it's easy and at times it's hard. The thing that's most important is that it's fun, the good kind of fun, the one that grows you and molds you into a better person. I think we are all a one big problem.
