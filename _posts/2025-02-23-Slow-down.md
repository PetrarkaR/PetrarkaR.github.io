# The hiccups
I believe life likes to test people in all sorts of ways, either be it through long trials and tribulations or through quick bursts of misery. I believe my path is the combination of those two, doesn't really ever let me go from the tests, but when I'm being tested it's not so well distributed either.

With the latest wave of responsibilities, I took up on a lot of weight on my shoulders, now I got more on my plate, new research paper, new everything. Gotta re-plan, re-focus, re-do my strategies. It's a whole new world ahead of me out there. I gotta be ready to tackle it, I feel this emotional and physical slowdown is a part of something much bigger. A dip before the rise. There's a whole lot in my life to process currently.

Still gotta evaluate the fact I might become a scientist, which way is my life going, will I do this or that, will my selfish nature save me and make me preserve my sanity above all.
