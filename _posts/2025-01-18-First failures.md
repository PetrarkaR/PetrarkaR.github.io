# First prototyping failure

It didn't take a lot of time to be honest, I have been developing a piece of commercial software for a month now, alas here we are, first time I hear "it does not work". It was a lot to take in at first, but it just doesn't work. Plain and simple and it takes a bit of courage to admit that to yourself, no excuses, just re-do it. That's what I intend to do anyway. Stick through it and work hard, it's gonna come eventually.
