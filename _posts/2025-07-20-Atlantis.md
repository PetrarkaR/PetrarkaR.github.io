# Things that we have lost

I like to think about the Atlantis and all the other theoretical things that civilization has lost over time, what ancient arts, crafts, technologies do we no longer have access to. Why didn't we go to the moon again (apart from the fact it is of little use).

For me it's hard to think about things like that, I always tended to lean more towards individualism, so my vision of the collective loss has always been a little skewed. I do not think I could handle a personal loss, if in some alternate universe I was conscious of who I am now, and suddenly got dementia I think death would be preferable. Alas knowing what I know about myself know in the case of dementia I would just invent a new personality once again.

The question we are trying to create here is "what would be your personal Atlantis?", it is really odd to try to create a question, it has to be well formed, structured, yet the answer has to be open and without a predictable outcome. This could maybe work, sometimes it's not about what are you willing to gain but what are you unwilling to lose.

It's often scary to think about sacrificing a piece of yourself to get to be something else, it's quite an uncomfortable feeling. I don't like to think about it.

In the end I would like to ask, what would be your personal Atlantis?
