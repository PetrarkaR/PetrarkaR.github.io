# Jest

So I've been reading this book by David Foster Wallace now, "Infinite Jest", pretty cool book, collection of short stories, some of them funny some of them surreal, takes me about anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes per story, but what's cool about is there is so much depth in each and every one of the stories, I could stretch out the small ones to 30 minutes too if I wanted to, I'm gonna put out some of the fun things I've read in this book here, hope someone enjoys them if they didn't read the book.

'My application's not bought,' I am telling them, calling into the darkness of the red cave that opens out before closed eyes. 'I
am not just a boy who plays tennis. I have an intricate history. Experiences and feelings. I'm complex.
'I read,' I say. 'I study and read. I bet I've read everything you've read. Don't think I haven't. I consume libraries. I wear out
spines and ROM-drives. I do things like get in a taxi and say, "The library, and step on it." My instincts concerning syntax and
mechanics are better than your own, I can tell, with due respect.
'But it transcends the mechanics. I'm not a machine. I feel and believe. I have opinions. Some of them are interesting. I could,
if you'd let me, talk and talk. Let's talk about anything. I believe the influence of Kierkegaard on Camus is underestimated. I
believe Dennis Gabor may very well have been the Antichrist. I believe Hobbes is just Rousseau in a dark mirror. I believe, with
Hegel, that transcendence is absorption. I could interface you guys right under the table,' I say. 'I'm not just a creãtus,
manufactured, conditioned, bred for a function.’
I open my eyes. 'Please don't think I don't care.’

it's a bit long, but it's by far the most relatable thing I've read in a while, if only my counselor could see this.

But he would force himself to do it anyway. He would smoke it all even if he didn't
want it. Even if it started to make him dizzy and ill. He would use discipline and persistence and will and make the whole
experience so unpleasant, so debased and debauched and unpleasant, that his behavior would be henceforward modified, he'd
never even want to do it again because the memory of the insane four days to come would be so firmly, terribly emblazoned in his
memory. He'd cure himself by excess.
