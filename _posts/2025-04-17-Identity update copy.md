# Update

It was about 2 weeks since the previous blogpost and a bit more than 3 months since the last persona update, with a firm belief I think I can say that the persona, the identity, the WHO is crafted. How? 

There were many long and sleepless night in the previous months, weeks, days, various things happening, from good to bad, from things going from bad to worse really quick. It took me a bit of time to find myself in all of that. But I got it down in the end. 

The point of this post is that I wanna write down who is it that I am exactly, when I die how I wanna be remembered. Not that I plan on dying of course, not any time soon. 

Through reading, although I am ashamed to say that I have not read a lot during these past couple of years, I must say my reading capacity and quantity has increased tremendeously in the previous few months. I went from none at all to... well... reading. 

That is one thing I want to be remembered for. Being a scholar. I must increase my knowledge acqusition. At least in some capacity. A philosopher and a techie. I want to be someone you turn to for advice both for your soul and your computer. I cannot guarantee I will be able to fix either.

There is a certain belief in me that wants to turn me into a robot. Not in a bad way. Robots are awesome. And that's what I aim to be, an awesome robot. Full of "life". Being self conscious is one way a robot can be awesome. I noted to myself before that I use "I" too much, to think that we are trying to reduce the ego after reading Nietszche.

So what now, we got a philosopher, a tech-person, what more? I was thinking in the line of someone who is persistent. Like Sisyphus, just going at it, but the boulder gets heavier every single day. That seems fun. That certainly a way you could describe me. 

Not really sure what I could put into my manifesto. These are 3 things people could go off of. I think that's enough for now. I'll keep adding things as I think of them.
