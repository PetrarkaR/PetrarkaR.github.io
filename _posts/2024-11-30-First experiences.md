# Trials

As of recently I have been put on a few trials, first article published, exams, daily studies, challenges, a hackathon and a new project with a company. I don't know how or why all of these opportunities came upon me or why, but it still is amazing that I get to continuously test and prove myself to... myself. And to be frank, I think I can finally say, that I am legitimately proud of myself and all of that I have achieved in the recent past. I've went above and beyond many times to show everyone that I can prove that I am as capable and as serious about things as I claim to be. I did not intend to include a single link in this post, cause it is all me(I will still include links in my post cause I like reading). 

## Emotion

There was a lot of emotion in the past few days I cannot lie, everything from sadness to euphoria, from exhaustion to . I don't think I could possibly explain anything that I've felt without going into the exact circumstances that have made me feel that way, but I'll try to go ahead and summarize and explain how it was for me in the previous week.


# Individual challenges

I'll skim over the specific things that have happened in the hope of capturing the general feeling I have felt, they will be listed in the order of magnitude in which they have impacted my mental.

## Daily studies

Every single day I could, meaning every single day I had the energy, I tried to sink in a study session, doesn't matter if there was nothing to study, I did my best to focus on learning SOMETHING, even though the test is 2 weeks away, I tried my best to sink in a few hours, and oh boy did they count, every single day I managed to study I felt tired afterwards but the build-up of mental resilience and the general studying made me so much more prepared, for the eventual test to be honest. I don't think I'll ever stop doing this(unless an outside factor prevents me), but this is something that is genuinely something that has allowed me to score 86% on a test I basically didn't have the energy for. So I will have to say that this is something that was the biggest investment knowledge wise, and is paying it's dividends.

## Daily problems

For the past 2 weeks I have been doing 2 problems a day, one of more mathematical/computing nature and one was always more algorithmic, as computer science students would do, the point was consistency. It has been extremely hard, every day, coding for 2-3 hours solving things, researching, solving problems, and there is so so so much more to learn, I haven't touched a single data structure problem. I do not know them. In due time I will conquer them as well. This has been extremely rewarding in a sense that some things just come naturally at this point, but it has been taking a big toll on my energy and frustration levels, still, I'll continue to do this to finish all the problems I think are worth it.

## First article published

This, I'd have to say this is something I'm proud of, it didn't really do anything for me, all I did was write some quality documentation for a project. Nothing more, it is just a relief to see it stand somewhere, I have my name in a ["book"](https://doi.ub.kg.ac.rs/ieestec17/), under the number 10.46793/IEEESTEC17.283R. It just feels nice having something you made out there, everything I do now is out there on Github. There will be more. More science, more knowledge, more everything.

## Hackathon

I feel like this is the biggest thing I did in this period, this was amazing. I am so proud, I made the code I did public on [github](https://github.com/PetrarkaR/arduinoHackathon). Wow, just one big wow, 12 hours of pure work, pure unadulterated work. Creating code, making problems, fixing problems, testing, fixing, breaking, every single verb you can imagine was there. Every single emotion, I feel like I cannot write anything to describe it. I have done everything in my power to achieve the place I did, 2nd place, I put every single atom of my being into success, and I felt it. I feel proud, and I have succeeded. There were moments of big frustration, I felt wronged, I felt cheated, but that doesn't impact me, cause that is not up to me. That is just wow, this is a totally new feeling, the proud feeling is something I have never felt about myself. Only for that, I would do this all again. Doesn't matter what place I get, I may be last next time. But I'd still feel proud. I wanna compete more, I want to play more, there is a whole 'nother world out there and I want to conquer it. There will be ripples because of this. There is light that needs to be shown to the world, and it will beam through the cracks these challenges show. 

## Exams

This came upon me like a cherry on top, 12 hours of work, falling on my bed from exhaustion, waking up and then absolutely dominating the test, doing 86%, leaving afterwards. I feel proud of that, it was tough, but we did it you know. To call it an overnight success it would be stupid, I had worked 3 weeks before that. That's how success is achieved. that's how I do it. Continued effort. E^2, education and effort.

## Project

This is something that came in "overnight" I didn't plan it. It just came upon me, even though I at first was skeptical, I think something will come out of it, more updates soon. It made me happy that people believe in me, and I will not take that for granted, more good things are coming.

# Conclusion

They didn't believe in us, but we did it. We outworked them all. And we will continue doing it. I am not afraid to succeed, and I will keep on making steps towards success. Godspeed.
