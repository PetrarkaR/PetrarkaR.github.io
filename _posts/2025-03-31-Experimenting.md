# Experiments
Recently I had a lot on my plate, well I currently do anyway, but I decided to take a step back, I thought it would be the best for everyone and everything, it's still taking me a bit to process everything, I am currently dealing with a lot. Maybe the fact I start every sentence with "I" is a problem as well. Been dwelling on that too. There should be a major restructuring as to how I write things. 

But anyway, let me proceed. There are many things in the world worth experimenting with. Psychedelics primarily. Just kidding. Or am I? Not really sure still, I have to do my research. There is a reason for me to believe that they do carry a benefit, although minor, I still wish to investigate, in what way, I am not sure, surely there is literature on this. 

Experimenting like a child is I believe still the only form of life worth living, just constantly tinkering, playing, researching, what else is there to do in life but turn every stone and look under every crevasse? Especially now that there so many crevasses to turn. That's what I aim to do. Research and understand. Experiment and document. 

There is an urge within me to find it all. Explore both the human spirit and the human mind. It's time to explode. Finally. 2025.
