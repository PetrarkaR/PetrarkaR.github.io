# First time succeeding

It doesn't come easy at all lmao, at least not for me, it took so much trial and error before I got it downt to this. Let me clue you in for a second. So there's this [hackathon](https://www.br41n.io/) right? Last year I was a bit busy so I had to skip, but this year; had to lock in and try to compete for the first time in my life (it turned out to be the second time for me to compete, see the first time in another issue of this blog, #First_Experiences). After I applied, got assigned to a team, got in contact, the first thought that occured to me was; okay this is gonna be good. And... surprisingly it was. We had some issues organizing the team in the beginning due to the people not turning up, so we had to merge teams, but once we got that down, we started rolling, assigned everyone their corresponding tasks. Me and Hannah got the data augmentation. What does that mean? No idea in the beginning. Had to read some papers, try to do some implementation, worked out in the end, after grueling 13 hours of programming and testing. We got it down. And we got 2nd place. Finally the skills are paying off. 

# Afterthoughts

It feels good to win, to get validated. Might look for this feeling more often.
