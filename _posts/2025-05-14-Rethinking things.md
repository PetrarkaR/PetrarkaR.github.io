# Addiction

I just wanted to get this out there as someone struggling with things, that it's not as easy at times to perform at the highest level, show your worth and be competitive at all times. It takes a lot more than skill to be successfull and at times it takes a whole lot more than skill.
Sometimes it takes to be normal. Sometimes it takes to not be normal. What would I know. Being addicted is a weird extreme where people can either praise you or diminish who you are as a person, if it suits them, if it threatens them.
It's a broad spectrum really. But at times you gotta really wonder, is an addict who you really are at your core, do you really need that one thing to function and does your identity depend on it, I'd like to think not, so I'll be making an effort to abstain from my addictions in the following months, to take a stand against my own desires. I think it's a fun experience.
Computers are not addicts. They don't "need" anything to function apart from their basic internals. Maybe I'm interpreting it wrong, and maybe they do have things they cannot go without that are not the internals. I think only living things can be addicts.

## Moving forward

Who knows what's out there moving forward. Maybe it's me, maybe it's not me, maybe I've yet to face myself. I'm on the right track though
