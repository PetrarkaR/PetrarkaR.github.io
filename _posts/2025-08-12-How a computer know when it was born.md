# Few beers and a lore exchange

What's the title about? What computers? There are no computers in this story. I just liked the lyric I heard in a song by Geohot, makes sense. But okay, maybe it has a bit of connection to what I wanna talk about here, how do you decide or know when does your story start, can you even mark the ending of a chapter.

Cartoons and movies have it easy, you just do a jump cut. Simple. Real life, not so much, there's a bit more nuance, a bit more to think about, a bit more to chew on and swallow.

With that I think to myself. When was I even born,  I'm not the same I was when I exited the womb, nor was I the same person I was 3 years ago. When do you draw the line. 

I decided it will be 8 months ago when I had my cute little interlude in my village, thinking about everything while being trapped in a village no bigger than 500 people. Makes you feel like you're such a big deal, you're not. You're just a big dog in a small scrapyard.

Thinking about when you were born is a lot more introspective than one may think, reimagining your whole spectrum of reality around the fact that you are not the same as you once were and that the world around changed as you did. That feels nice. Well, depending on which direction your change took place in, you can always change for the worse, but you may never stay the same. I think I would rather get worse than stay the same. I have been doing a good job with that, practice a bit of good self destruction.

It's not about hopelessly embracing the decay. It's more about knowing what you're doing, letting go of everything you don't need. That's good. That's when you can know you are being reborn, reiterated upon.

How would a computer know when it was born anyway? When a web-page asks you are you above the age of 18? Do you always think you're mature enough to say yes? You tell me.
