# Autism

Recently I've been thinking a lot about autism. I remember the first time I actually got asked if I were autistic. It was in 2022, funnily 
enough it was when autism as a concept started becoming trending on Google trends, probably via [Tiktok](https://www.ncsautism.org/blog//the-tiktok-effect-how-the-social-media-app-helps-spread-autism-misinformationnbsp). 
Ever since then I was introduced to it I've been thinking about it, 
am I autistic? 

To be honest at every point of my life I would've thought no. I see myself as a functioning individual in every aspect of life. 

But recently there have been anomalies all around me. People calling each other "autistic" all the time started to surround me. So I started to do some research to
not let myself get convinced by an outside source that I am or someone else is autistic, so after a bit of reading I figured it is in fact a trend. Autism became
just another way to label yourself, just like [ADHD](https://www.beyondclinics.co.uk/blog/is-adhd-trend). [Study for reference](https://www.autismspeaks.org/science-news/why-autism-increasing).

I think people put too much thought into it, start to make it into a lifestyle, as in they do things differently just cause they are on some surface level "autistic"
albeit in a very shallow manner. I think I fell down into that at one point as well, thinking I have some "unnatural" intelligence just cause my brain chemistry
is a bit different than the rest. Later I stopped thinking that but the delusions have already been set. My point is that people tend to overvalue the labels
other people put on them, if I were really autistic I don't think I would do anything different. It's just a word. Won't change anything about me anyway. 

## Intelligence

Once again funnily enough [autism has been linked with LOWER intelligence scores in children and adults](https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/11/13/autism-and-intelligence-much-more-than-you-wanted-to-know/) 
which is ironic since most of the people you meet around you probably refer to "autistic" people as the nerds in math class. That devolves down to people calling
people autistic for having academic interests which totally puts me off, why cannot we describe each other as people who have a passion for something rather than a
brain disease? 

Anyway. As a signing note I wanted to say to the world that I will not be calling myself autistic ever again, and that I shall describe myself as someone with 
a burning passion and love towards the world. I just want to have interests and not be labelled as someone with a disease for it. I love computers.
