# Is how you do everything

I've been thinking about that a lot,  seeing as recently I saw a youtube title with that title line, it's been on my mind, how I do one thing is how I do everything. I don't clean my room often. Or thouroughly for that matter. I just clean it, sloppily. Is that how I do everything ? Maybe. I am not sure. I know some of my work is exceptional and really good. But I do think I am sloppy most of the time. That's another point I want to improve upon, I want to get good at doing things perfectly, not to get too caught up in them but just do them how they should be done. Everything sleek. All diagrams lined up, equations marked. Right now I see myself as an artist, just smacking my brush against the canvas, that is okay, it leads me places, but in those places I need to recognize that I need to sit down and look at all the brush strokes, organize them and then compartmentalize everything. That will be the key to my success in the future I feel like, trying to achieve that "perfect" level. I have high standards and the key is to achieve them right?


## Writing

My writing is sporadic and often times just my stream of thoughts. But it is all "perfect" No bad spelling, no broken links. Why can't it all be that way? Writing is not hard in it's own sense, once you try to create something of substance, that's when it becomes hard, the technicalities of it are easy, but that is because I have been writing on the keyboard for years now, being technical is a skill. That's how I will approach this new task of "perfecting" my works. Learn how to treat them as systems.
