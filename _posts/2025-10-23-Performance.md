# Numbers

What about numbers? I like to compile everything into numbers. Maybe that's wrong. Don't really care. There is a certain beauty to numbers no word or experience that explain. The way they just say things how they are. They are so simple. One has been one since... well forever. It doesn't matter what you think of it. It's always one.

Sooo... my year. What has happened? For this year... you see, this year is kind of special. This year we will introduce graphs. I love graphs. Let's look at the overall performance over the years.

The explosion has been... absolutely crazy. I don't really know what more to say about it. It has been absolutely crazy. Sometimes I don't believe that was me. But you know what's even crazier. This is just the beginning:)

![Graph2][def2] 

But. We should all know this doesn't say anything. Just like it didn't say anything when I sucked. It doesnt say anything now that I'm great.

Just as meaningless as it was then. Don't forget to not give value to things just because they are yours, because you insulted them when they weren't

I never wished to have high numbers. My life was never about performing for others. It's just something that happens. When you put in the work the whole thing follows.
