# Accelerationism

Recently I was debating with myself an idea, [e\acc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism), how fast can you actually go. Go where? Through life, your own thoughts, political ideas, philosophies, how much can a man change while still being himself? Is a man a fixed idea? No idea. I cannot say, my friends often know me as a chameleon, in fact I do remember a friend telling me it annoys her having to get to know me again once every 6 months. Kinda scary now to think about it, but imagine what it's like in the mind that changes that often. I don't want to know.

In the end my thoughts came down to, is change part of my identity? Am I just the person who changes up often. I think I am, always adapting, overcoming and evolving. No idea if that's good or not. Can't stop won't stop. So in the end I decided I want to... accelerate my progress in every way, let all hell loose, thinking I don't care anymore about judgement, I just want to experience it all, even if I did fail to experience it the first time, I think now I'll have the time to do things to make up for all those times that I shied away from opportunity.}

Accelerationism at it's core comes down to just... not letting things stagnate and that the only way is forward, with which I agree, I do not think we should stop our progress for anything, but I was listening to a George Hotz [stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0EPuVlCtJk), he comes down to the conclusion that accelerationism is not a good long term way of thinking, with which again, I agree, progressing constantly is good, but there needs to be a time in which you settle down and learn to adapt to your progress. In a way it's similar to the way human bodies and brains haven't been able to adapt yet to the sedentary lifestyle and the fast paced environment, I mean just look at me, I've been sitting now for 9 hours, listening to 3 different pieces of media and writing a new entry in my public diary. Completely unhinged. 

## How to

Didn't really think much about how exactly does one accelerate. We'll see, it should't be as scary as it seems, just say "yes". Opportunities will come.
